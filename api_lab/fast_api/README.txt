# Wine Classification API

In this project, I trained a machine learning model on the Wine dataset, selecting key features through exploratory data analysis and correlation heatmaps. The trained model was saved using joblib and deployed via a FastAPI application, which exposes a `/predict` endpoint to receive wine characteristics as input and return the predicted wine class. The API was tested successfully, returning HTTP 200 responses with accurate predictions, demonstrating a seamless integration of data science and modern web deployment.
